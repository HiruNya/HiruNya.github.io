      <h1>What is Bioinformatics?</h1>
      <div class="quote">"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, biology, mathematics, statistics and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques. More broadly, bioinformatics is applied statistics and computing to biological science."

        Bioinformatics, both sequences and builds up databases that hold gene sequences, sequences of complete genomes, and amino acid sequences of proteins.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h1>Why are these databases needed?</h1>
      <p>
        Genome sequences, of a species, or amino acid sequences, of a protein, can be compared, by scientists, to the sequences found in these databases to find similarities and differences.
        This is useful for scientists studying a species as they can find common ancestors with other species.
        Scientists can also use the database to find other organisms which have identical or at least similar base sequences.
        This means that it is a powerful tool for evolutionary biologists who can track evolution by the changes in DNA sequances of an organims.
        <br>
        For example the genes concerned with development in humans are found in other species like the <i>Drosophila</i> Fruit Fly.
        </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This information can also be used to fight parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> as the whole genome of these species are available in databases. Researchers can use this information to develop new methods of treatment and develop effective vaccines for malaria.
      </p>
      <p>
        This information can also be used to help the species as researchers can create medicine that targets specific genes.

      <h1>Sequencing</h1>
      <p>
        The sequencing of DNA and other sequences are done by computers.<br />
        There a multiple varying methods of sequencing DNA however there are two primary ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        One method of sequencing is known as "Primer Walking" or "Chromosome Walking" which progresses through the entire strand piece by piece.
        This method is slow and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other method is known as "Shotgun Sequencing" which uses broken up DNA fragments and finds the overlapping areas of the different fragments and uses these overlapping areas to join the small fragments together to form one continuos DNA sequence.
        This method is faster but also more complex.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        One of the first significant experiments in bioinformatics is when FASTP, one of the first sequence similarity searching programs, was used to determine that the contents of "v-sis", a cancer-causing viral sequence, were similar to a cellular PDGF gene.
        This gave researchers a greater insight into how the viral sequence causes cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first genomes to have been sequenced were that of viruses and bacteria. The genome of <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> was the first genome of a free living organim to be published to a sequence databank.
        The sequencing of the human genome later on caused bioinformatics to gain in popularity.

      <h2>What is Bioinformatics?</h2>
      <div class="quote">"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, biology, mathematics, statistics and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques. More broadly, bioinformatics is applied statistics and computing to biological science."<span style="float: right">- Wikipedia</span></div>
      <p>
        Bioinformatics build up databases that hold gene sequences, sequences of complete genomes, and amino acid sequences of proteins.
      </p>
      <h2>Why are these databases needed?</h2>
      <p>
        Genome sequences, of a species, or amino acid sequences, of a protein, can be compared, by scientists, to the sequences found in these databases to find similarities and differences.
        This is useful for scientists studying a species as they can find common ancestors with other species.
        Scientists can also use the database to find other organisms which have identical or at least similar base sequences.
        <br>
        For example the genes concerned with development in humans are found in other species like the <i>Drosophila</i> Fruit Fly.
        </br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This information can also be used to fight parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> as the whole genome of these species are available in databases. Researchers can use this information to develop new methods of treatment and develop effective vaccines for malaria.
